# The effect of a blocked jump shot on future jump shots in the NBA

`blocked_jumper.py` is a script to find all occurrences of a player getting a jump shot blocked, and then divide up shots that game into "before" and "after".

See http://www.jeremyscheff.com/2013/04/the-effect-of-a-blocked-jump-shot-on-future-jump-shots-in-the-nba/ for background, motivation, and results.

The data comes from http://basketballvalue.com/downloads.php and running `blocked_jumper.py` displays some output and writes more to `output.json`.
